[kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) is a cross-platform software keyboard remapper for Linux, macOS and Windows. A short summary of the features:

- multiple layers of key functionality
- advanced key behaviour customization (e.g. tap-hold, macros, unicode)

This directory contains my personal Kanata setup, including the executable and configuration file.

## Key Files

- `kanata.exe`: The Kanata executable for Windows.
- `kanata.kbd`: My personal Kanata keybinding configuration file. This file defines custom layers, macros, and key behaviors.

## How to Use

To use this setup, run `kanata.exe --config kanata.kbd` from this directory or ensure `kanata.exe` is in your PATH and run it with the specified config file.

For more detailed information on Kanata and its configuration, please refer to the [official Kanata documentation](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/blob/main/docs/README.md).

## Backup and Portability

These files serve as a backup for my Kanata settings and allow for easy setup on a new Windows machine.
